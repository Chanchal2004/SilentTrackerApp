# 🚨 Silent Tracker – Hidden Emergency Location App

Silent Tracker is a hidden Android application designed to silently track and send a user's location to Firebase at regular intervals. The app is built with safety in mind, especially for women or vulnerable individuals during emergencies. It operates quietly in the background without any UI or active interaction, and can optionally send SMS alerts to pre-defined emergency contacts. The location data is stored securely in Firebase and can be displayed on Google Maps.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

This project is developed using Java/Kotlin for Android, with integration of Firebase Realtime Database to store user location data. It also uses the Google Maps API for location display and Android SDK for handling background services and permissions.

## 🧪 How to Run the App

To run the app, first clone this repository to your local machine and open it in Android Studio. You will need to create a Firebase project and enable Firebase Realtime Database. Once done, download the `google-services.json` file from your Firebase console and place it inside the `app/` directory of this project. Make sure the app has location permissions configured in both the manifest file and runtime handling. After setting everything up, you can run the app either on an emulator or a real Android device (running Android 8.0 or higher). The app will begin sending location data to Firebase automatically in the background once it's launched.
